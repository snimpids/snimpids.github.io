    <h2> Research </h2>
    <p>
      My area of research is in applications of mathematics to image processing. During my MSc, <br />
      I am focusing on the problem of noise removal in digital images.
    </p>
    
    <h2> Teaching </h2>
    <p>
      I enjoy the challenge of making complex concepts understandable to non-experts. Teaching <br />
      is one of my favorite aspects of academic life, and gives me the opportunity to directly <br />
      inspire uprising students to think deeply about the mathematical world around them.
